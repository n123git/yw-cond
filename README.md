# yw-cond
A web-based W.I.P Cond analyser for the Yo-kai Watch series.

This parser is for the Yo-kai Watch franchise which has a more complex cond set (and some slight changes) from Inazuma Eleven, for IEGO cond parsing take a look at the newly released [level5_condition](https://github.com/Tiniifan/level5_condition/) made by Tiniifan themself!

# CExpression (Cond) System Documentation

The **CExpression**, or **Cond system**, is a proprietary (usually Base64-encoded) system used for evaluating runtime conditions.

## 1. **Core Concepts**

* **CExpression**: The whole conditional system itself; contains 1 or more conditions. Can consist of:

  * Literal values (constants)
  * Functions (engine calls or runtime queries)
  * Operators (arithmetic, logical, or bitwise)

---

## 2. **Cond Structure**

Each Cond begins with a **4-byte header** and a **2-byte COND_CODE**.
> Note: This is *PER-COND as a whole, NOT* per condition.

### 2.1 Header (4 bytes)
The header is always equivalent to `00 00 00 00` and has no impact on the cond itself. This is most likely used as a sort of integrity check.

### 2.2 Cond Code (2 bytes)
| Byte | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The first byte of COND_CODE defines the total length excluding itself but including all subsequent bytes within the Cond - including the second byte; in some conds with many conditions this is set to `F0`. |
| 2    | Most likely represents the number of pushes to the stack, although due to it's inconsistency and my laziness the true purpose is unknown.                                                                     |

> Example: `00 00 00 00 - 0F 05 - 35 10 B1 40 96 00 01 00 32 00 00 00 01 78`,


* The **first byte** is *NOT* included in the length.
* The **second byte** is usually unknown but part of the header and counts towards the first byte's length calculation.

## 5. **Read Operations**

### 5.1 READ_MEMORY

A READ_MEMORY entry is structured as:

```
READ_MEMORY
  LITERAL_VALUE (4 bytes)
  CTYPE (3 bytes; type of the above value)
  optional:EXTENSION_DELIM (1 byte)
     CTYPE (3 bytes; type of the below value)
     READ_SUBSECTION (1 byte)
     LITERAL_VALUE
  ... can recursively hold another CTYPE then EXTENSION_DELIM and so on
```

* The **4-byte literal value** is the value (for integers; although usually still an ID) or CRC32 ISO-HDLC hash of the function name (for functions).
  * Literal Values are *big-endian*.
* Optional **EXTENSION_DELIM+READ_SUBSECTION** chins allow unlimited nesting of subsections for multi-param functions.

### 5.2 READ_LITERAL

* Always followed by a **32-bit integer** (but may also be used for 16-bit, 8-bit, or boolean values, in which case it will still be padded to 4 bytes).
* Values are **big-endian**.

### 5.3 READ_SUBSECTION

* Always follows an EXTENSION_DELIM/CTYPE combination.
* Represents a smaller section of memory or another value block.

## 5. **Internal Data Types**

These data types are **never directly referenced in the CExpression itself** but are used internally by the engine during execution and will therefore be mentioned here cuz why not :P

| ID | Type   | Description             |
| -- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| 0  | int8   | 8-bit signed integer    |
| 1  | uint8  | 8-bit unsigned integer  |
| 2  | int16  | 16-bit signed integer   |
| 3  | uint16 | 16-bit unsigned integer |
| 4  | int32  | 32-bit signed integer   |
| 5  | uint32 | 32-bit unsigned integer |
| 6  | float  | 32-bit floating point   |
| 7+ | unk    | Currently unknown.      |

---

## 6. **CTypes (True Data Types)**

CTypes are **3-byte descriptors** representing data types used in the engine.

| Byte | Purpose                |
| ---- | ---------------------- |
| 1    | Always `00`            |
| 2    | Data Type              |
| 3    | ExtData:               |

* For functions, extdata represents the number of parameters
* For integers, the purpose of extdata is unknown although it is usually `02`.

### 6.1 CType Examples

| CType      | Meaning                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `00 06 02` | 32-bit integer (also used for 16-bit, 8-bit, and boolean) |
| `00 1C 03` | 3-parameter function                                      |
| `00 13 02` | 2-parameter function                                      |
| `00 0A 01` | 1-parameter function                                      |
| `00 01 00` | 0-parameter function                                      |

> **Note:** The first byte is always `00`. Functions use extdata to indicate the **parameter count**.

---

### 7. Examples and Notes
Due to the lack of an array data type functions are often used to emulate this, take for instance the function `0x77B463E5`. It takes the param(s): `(int: index)` and returns a boolean output. Specifically, you input a Psychic Blasters Stage Index and it tells you if that boss has/hasn't been defeated yet.

Due to the lack of a string or enum data type, CRC-32 ISO-HDLC hashes are often used instead with lookup table functions.
CExpression Functions aren't always read only - take for instance `RunTrigger` (0x6984E3AF), it takes in a big endian ID, runs the trigger and always returns `1` (`true`).

The Naming Schema of CExpression Functions can be shown as follows:
* Always Pascal Case; unlike normal IDs where level5 uses a mix of lowercase and snakecase.
* A mix of english and hepburn romanisation.
* Quite rare typos, take for instance: `IsApeearMitibiki`.
* Abbreviations used such as `Util`, `Cnt` etc.
* Common prefixes include `Get`, `Set`, `Is`, `Common` and `Has`.
* Common suffixes include `Cnt`, `Num`, `Now` and `Rate`.

Cond Examples:
* Set Cond: RunTrigger:
  * `00 00 00 00 12 02 35 69 84 E3 AF 00 0A 01 28 00 06 02 34 0E 6B 6F 6B`
  * This can be parsed as:
    * `00 00 00 00` - Header
    * `12 02` - Condcode; shows the cond's length and that 2 values will be pushed to stack.
    * `35` - READ_MEMORY; tells the game what layout to expect and to read a value.
    * `69 84 E3 AF` - The CRC32 hash of `RunTrigger`.
    * `00 0A 01` - The CTYPE for a function that takes one parameter aka `RunTrigger` in this example.
    * `28` - Used to tell the engine to keep reading so it correctly parses the params.
    * `00 06 02` - The CTYPE for an integer; refering to the input of `RunTrigger` aka the `TriggerID`
    * `34`- Similar purpose as `28`.
    * `0E 6B 6F 6B` - Input of the funcion; pushes the function and params to the stack.
    * No OPERATORs or other values; so it runs the above function and checks if the output is truthy; as this function is a `Set` not a `Get/Is/Has` function it always returns `1` (`true`); a *truthy* value.
* Get Cond: GameClear (Has Main Story been completed):
  * `00 00 00 00 0F 05 35 10 B1 40 96 00 01 00 32 00 00 00 01 78`
  * This can be parsed as:
    * `00 00 00 00` - Header
    * `0F 05` - Condcode.
    * `35` - READ_MEMORY; tells the game what layout to expect and to read a value.
    * `10 B1 40 96` - The CRC32 hash of `GameClear`.
    * `00 01 00` - The CType for a Zero-Param Function; telling the engine to not parse any params, pushing the function's output as a value to stack.
    * `32` - A READ_LITERAL telling the parser to expect a literal value next.
    * `00 00 00 01` - A literal value equivalent to `1` (`true`) which promptly gets pushed to stack.
    * `78` - an OPERATOR; specifically `==`; it compares both values in stack and returns a boolean output deciding whether the cond fails or succeeds.

---

### 8. History

* IEGO (2011, December)
  * IEGO had a very simplistic cond system, with only 4 used CExpression Functions, (3 used CTYPEs?) and 7 used Operators (including `8F`).
* Yo-kai Watch 1 (2013, July)
  * Level5 made alot of changes in this game - which makes sense considering how long they were working on it for; this can be proven by the files in Yo-kai Watch 2 that haven't been touched since 2011!
  * Yo-kai Watch 1 for smartphone had over 20 operators, multi-param functions and 118 CExpression functions!
  * Overall this is what truly started the modern cond system.
* ... future game's have not changed the format much aside from adding/removing CExpression Functions

## 9. **W.I.P General Flow **

1. The system begins by reading and validating the HEADER and CONDCODE.
2. Then it reads the next byte i.e. if its a READ_LITERAL, OPERATOR etc
3. Then it keeps going until it finds values to push to stack
2. Operators are always binary (take 2 inputs) and return an output.
3. Functions are the only arbitrary size data type due to the them having up to 255 parameters (although in practice more than 3 has not been witnessed) which can all be functions which contain functions and so on.
4. Logical evaluation uses `&&` (`8F`) and `||` (`90`) markers.
5. The engine resolves the final result based on literals, function returns, and operator results.
