A web-based W.I.P Cond analyser for the Yo-kai Watch series.
This parser is for the Yo-kai Watch franchise which has a more complex cond set (and some slight changes) from Inazuma Eleven, for IEGO cond parsing take a look at [level5_condition](https://github.com/Tiniifan/level5_condition/) made by Tiniifan themself!

## Cond Timeline
* IEGO (2011, first cond system known; extremely simplistic)
  ->
* YW1 (2013, lorem ipsum)
  ->
* YW2 (2014) Complex, multi-layered container format with support for multi-dimensional arrays.
->
* (Hasn't really changed much since but are prevelant in later games like YW4 and Snack World)
